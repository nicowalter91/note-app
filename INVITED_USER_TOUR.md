# Invited User Tour Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive onboarding tour system for invited users (team members) with role-based content and interactive overlays/tooltips.

## Features Implemented

### 1. InvitedUserTour Component (`src/components/Tour/InvitedUserTour.jsx`)
- **Role-based tour steps**: Content adapts based on user's role and permissions
- **Interactive tooltips**: Positioned tooltips that highlight relevant UI elements
- **Progress tracking**: Shows current step and completion percentage
- **Skip/Complete options**: Users can skip or complete the tour
- **Responsive positioning**: Tooltips automatically adjust to stay within viewport

#### Supported Roles:
- **Assistant Coach**: Full access to training and player management
- **Caretaker**: Focus on player welfare and team logistics
- **Physiotherapist**: Player injury tracking and physical condition
- **Analyst**: Statistics and performance data analysis

### 2. Data-Tour Attributes
Added `data-tour` attributes to navigation elements for tour targeting:
- `players-menu`: Team Management menu
- `training-menu`: Training & Exercises menu  
- `statistics-submenu`: Statistics submenu
- `finance-submenu`: Team Finance submenu
- `settings-menu`: Settings menu
- `navbar`: Main navigation bar

### 3. Backend Integration

#### User Controller Updates (`backend/controllers/user.js`)
- Extended `getUser` endpoint to include team member information for invited users
- Added `completeTour` function to mark tour as completed
- Returns user type, onboarding status, and team member permissions

#### New API Endpoint
- `PUT /complete-tour`: Marks tour as completed for invited users

#### Database Schema
- User model already supports `userType` ('main' | 'invited') and `onboardingCompleted` fields
- TeamMember model provides role-based permissions

### 4. Frontend Integration

#### Dashboard Integration (`src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`)
- Detects invited users who haven't completed onboarding
- Shows tour automatically on first login
- Handles tour completion and state updates
- Added `main-content` class for tour targeting

#### Tour Service (`src/utils/tourService.js`)
- API integration for tour completion
- Error handling for tour-related operations

#### Settings Page Enhancement (`src/pages/Settings/Settings.jsx`)
- Added "Help & Development Tools" section
- Onboarding reset functionality for testing
- Help options for users

### 5. Tour Flow

1. **User Login**: Invited user logs in for the first time
2. **Detection**: Dashboard detects `userType: 'invited'` and `onboardingCompleted: false`
3. **Tour Start**: InvitedUserTour component is rendered with user and team member data
4. **Role-based Steps**: Tour adapts content based on user's role and permissions
5. **Interactive Guide**: Tooltips highlight relevant navigation elements
6. **Completion**: User completes or skips tour, API call marks it as done
7. **Future Visits**: Tour won't show again as `onboardingCompleted: true`

### 6. Tour Steps Structure

#### Base Steps (All Users):
1. Welcome message with role introduction
2. Role-specific navigation highlights

4. Completion message

#### Role-specific Content:

- **Contextual**: Explains what the user can do in their role
- **Action-oriented**: Guides users to relevant sections

### 7. Technical Features

- Overlay prevents interaction until completion

#### State Management:

### 8. Testing & Development Tools

#### Settings Integration:

#### Error Handling:
- Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- User feedback for errors
- Automatic cleanup on failures

## Usage
